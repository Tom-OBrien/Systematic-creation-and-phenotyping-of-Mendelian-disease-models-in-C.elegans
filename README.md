# Systematic-creation-and-phenotyping-of-Mendelian-disease-models-in-C.elegans

The code in this repository is used to generate all of the figures found in: “Systematic creation and phenotyping of Mendelian disease models in C. elegans: towards large-scale drug repurposing” ( https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.92491.4). The datasets needed to run the code can be found in the Zenodo repository linked in the paper.

All of this code will also need to be ran in an environment with Tierpsy and TierpsyTools installed. These can be downloaded from our group’s GitHub Repository: https://github.com/Tierpsy

Once the datasets are downloaded to a personal location the global variables (top of code) for every script will need to be updated with the correct path to the data. The names for these files, and their position within the repository are consistent with the path’s used in current placeholders found in the code. Similarly, a local save path will need to be provided of each script to catch the outputs of each script and the location to the helper.py script will need to be updated.
